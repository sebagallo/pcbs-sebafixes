# PCBS - SebaFixes

Small mod I developed for pc building simulator to fix some annoyances I found with the base game.

## Features

Contains the following fixes/enhancements/QOL:
- No price check for Air Cooler, Liquid Cooler and Motherboard replacements
- Can replace Air Cooler with Liquid Cooler (not the opposite)
- Faster dust cleaning
- Software installation/removal without rebooting
- USB drive not needed for OS/software installation
- PCBay PC Auctions made more profitable (finally you can break even and make a little profit on the side)
- More PCBay Auctions!

Each of these options can easily be turned off or on, if you also install the ConfigurationManager Plugin.  
Alternatively, after the first run a config file will be generated in `BepInEx/config`, there you can easily change the values.

## Requirements

- [Bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) installed
- [Bepinex.ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases) (optional, for in-game config)
